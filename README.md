User instructions: Instances and packages required to run codes-- not provided here, other licenses required; compile and run instructions-- input parameters, etc.

* kplex.cpp: The code for solving the maximum _k_-plex problem.
* Makefile: Make file to compile kplex.cpp in a linux system.

# Compiling the code
1. Configure the Linux environment with Gurobi as described in the paper.
2. Copy kplex.cpp and Makefile into a same folder
3. In terminal, go to the folder. Then type _make_ and hit enter to compile kplex.cpp

# Execution
1. Create an _input_ folder to place input instances, and create an _output_ folder for outputs
2. The code create an executale program named "prog". Use "qsub" command or double click to run it depending on the Linux environment
